# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the
# following:


# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

# input 2 integers
# add two integers
# return sum

# GET integer 1
# GET integer 2
# SET sum as sum of two integers
# PRINT sum


# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is 
# all those strings concatenated together

# get the array of strings
# concatenate the array with spaces in between
# display the output

# GET array of strings
# SET result as a concatenation of items in the array
# PRINT result


# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array 
# with every other element

# get an array
# subset the array with every other element
# output the new subsetted array

# GET the array
# SET a new array as a subset of the original array
# PRINT the new array
